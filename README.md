# querybm

[![CI](https://github.com/tecowl/querybm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tecowl/querybm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A simple SQL query builder and mapper. `querybm` works well with models generated by [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/). But it works with your models without sqlc.

## FEATURES

- [x] No dependencies
- [x] Build SELECT statement dynamically with struct type
- [x] Mapping with generics instead of reflection
- [ ] 100% test coverage

See [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tecowl/querybm) for more details.
